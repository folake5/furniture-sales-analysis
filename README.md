## âœ… Recommendations

Based on insights from the analysis, here are some actionable recommendations:

1. *Focus Marketing Efforts on West Region*  
   The West region consistently generates the highest profit. Increasing marketing or expanding inventory here could further boost revenue.

2. *Re-evaluate Product Strategy in the South*  
   The South region showed lower profit margins. Investigate potential causes (e.g., customer preferences or shipping costs) and consider adjusting pricing or promotions.

3. *Target the Corporate Segment*  
   Corporate customers deliver the most sales value. Tailoring offers or loyalty programs to this segment can increase retention and revenue.
